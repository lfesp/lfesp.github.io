# my personal website!

a static personal website to provide my contact info, display my personal and professional projects, and hopefully bump middle school photos off of the first page of my Google search results.

developed primarily during Princeton's arrival quarantine at the start of my freshman spring semester (spring 2020) as a means of getting myself more familiar with Gatsby.
